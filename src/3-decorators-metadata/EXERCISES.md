# Part 3: Decorators + Metadata Integration Exercises

This directory contains practical exercises demonstrating how decorators and metadata work together to create powerful, declarative programming patterns used in professional frameworks.

## Prerequisites

Prerequisites for these exercises include:
- Completion of Part 1 (Decorators Fundamentals)
- Completion of Part 2 (Metadata Operations)
- Understanding of TypeScript generics and advanced types
- Familiarity with design patterns (Observer, Factory, Decorator)
- Reading the **THEORY.md** file for integration concepts

## Setup Requirements

Your project needs the following configuration:

```json
// tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "experimentalDecorators": true,
    "emitDecoratorMetadata": true,
    "lib": ["ES2020", "DOM"]
  }
}
```

```bash
# Install reflect-metadata (should already be installed)
yarn add reflect-metadata
```

Each exercise file includes `import 'reflect-metadata';` at the top.

## Exercise Structure

Each exercise contains implementation files and comprehensive test suites. The specific files vary by exercise - check each exercise's README.md for the exact structure.

## Common Integration Patterns

### Basic Decorator-Metadata Pattern
```typescript
import 'reflect-metadata';

// Decorator stores metadata
function ConfigProperty(key: string) {
  return function (target: any, propertyKey: string) {
    Reflect.defineMetadata('config:key', key, target, propertyKey);
  };
}

// Business logic reads metadata
function loadConfiguration(instance: any) {
  const constructor = instance.constructor;
  const properties = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(constructor.prototype);
  
  for (const prop of properties) {
    const configKey = Reflect.getMetadata('config:key', constructor.prototype, prop);
    if (configKey) {
      instance[prop] = process.env[configKey];
    }
  }
}
```

### Validation System Pattern
```typescript
// Store validation rules
function Required(target: any, propertyKey: string) {
  const rules = Reflect.getMetadata('validation:rules', target, propertyKey) || [];
  rules.push({ type: 'required' });
  Reflect.defineMetadata('validation:rules', rules, target, propertyKey);
}

// Execute validation
function validate(instance: any): ValidationResult {
  const errors: ValidationError[] = [];
  const properties = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(instance.constructor.prototype);
  
  for (const prop of properties) {
    const rules = Reflect.getMetadata('validation:rules', instance.constructor.prototype, prop);
    if (rules) {
      // Execute validation rules and collect errors
    }
  }
  
  return { valid: errors.length === 0, errors };
}
```

## Best Practices During Implementation

### Decorator Design
1. **Single Responsibility**: Each decorator should have one clear purpose
2. **Composability**: Design decorators to work well together
3. **Performance**: Minimize runtime overhead in decorator execution
4. **Type Safety**: Preserve and enhance TypeScript type information

### Metadata Management
1. **Namespace Keys**: Use prefixed keys like `'validation:required'`
2. **Avoid Collisions**: Use unique prefixes for different systems
3. **Document Schema**: Keep track of metadata structure and meaning
4. **Validate Data**: Validate metadata before using it

### Integration Patterns
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Keep decorator logic separate from business logic
2. **Error Handling**: Provide meaningful error messages and fallbacks
3. **Performance**: Cache metadata lookups for better performance
4. **Extensibility**: Design systems to be easily extended

## Testing Strategy

Each exercise includes comprehensive tests that verify:
- **Decorator Functionality**: Decorators work correctly and store proper metadata
- **Integration Patterns**: Decorators and metadata work together seamlessly
- **Edge Cases**: Error conditions and boundary cases are handled
- **Performance**: Systems perform well under load
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript types are preserved and enforced

## Next Steps

After mastering decorator-metadata integration, next steps include:
1. **Build Real Applications**: Applying these patterns to actual projects
2. **Create Frameworks**: Building custom decorator-based frameworks and libraries
3. **Contribute to Open Source**: Contributing to existing metadata-driven libraries
4. **Advanced TypeScript**: Exploring advanced TypeScript features for better decorator typing
